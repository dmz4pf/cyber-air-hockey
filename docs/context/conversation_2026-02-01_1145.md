# Context Snapshot - Two New Issues
**Date:** 2026-02-01 11:45

## Issues Reported
1. Ball doesn't start stationary at middle - it has velocity at game start
2. Both players see 3-2 score (score display mismatch)

## Fixes Needed
1. Remove initial velocity in `start()` - puck should be stationary until hit
2. Investigate score display - likely client-side rotation issue for Player 2
