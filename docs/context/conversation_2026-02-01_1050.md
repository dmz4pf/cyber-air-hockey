# Context Snapshot - Physics Fix Failed, Need Debug
**Date:** 2026-02-01 10:50

## Current State
My physics fix broke the game again. User requested comprehensive debug and plan mode.

## What Was Changed
- Removed `maintainMinimumSpeed()`
- Changed `validateAndRecoverPuckState()` to clamp + bounce
- Added initial velocity in `start()`
- Added `serveToward` parameter to `resetPuck()`
- Stop puck on goal, serve to loser

## Problem
Unknown - user says it's messed up. Need full investigation.

## Next Steps
1. Enter plan mode
2. Comprehensive debug of AI mode vs server mode
3. Create proper fix plan
