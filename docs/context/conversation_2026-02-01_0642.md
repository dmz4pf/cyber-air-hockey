# Context Snapshot - Air Hockey Winner Display Bug
**Date:** 2026-02-01 06:42
**Context Usage:** 329%

## Current Bug
Player lost 0-2 but was shown "VICTORY!" - winner determination is inverted.

## Previous Fixes This Session
1. Multiplayer detection using `gameModeType`
2. Null check for `playerNumber` in paddle moves
3. Disabled AI physics in multiplayer mode
4. Added puck interpolation for smooth movement

## Files to Check
- `src/components/cyber/game/MultiplayerGameOverModal.tsx` - Victory/Defeat logic
- Winner comes from server via `useMultiplayerGameEngine`

## Root Cause Hypothesis
The modal is comparing winner to playerNumber incorrectly, or scores are being displayed from wrong perspective.

## Next Steps
1. Fix winner determination in MultiplayerGameOverModal
2. Ensure "YOU" score shows current player's score
