## Current Issue: Puck Physics

User reports:
1. Puck moves on its own (should only move when hit by paddle)
2. Puck teleports at high velocity
3. Need to match AI mode physics

## Previous Fixes Applied
1. `maintainMinimumSpeed()` - Skip during goal pause and 1s after reset
2. Added `puckResetTime` timestamp tracking
3. Interpolation jump detection (>100px clears buffer)

## Files to Check
- `server/src/physics/engine.ts` - Server physics (maintainMinimumSpeed)
- `src/hooks/useGameEngine.ts` - AI mode physics (reference)
- `server/src/physics/config.ts` - Physics config values

## Architecture
- Frontend: port 3000 ✅
- Backend: port 4000 ✅
- Faucet URL: faucet.testnet-conway.linera.net ✅
